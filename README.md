Used to make life a bit easier.
Using the terminal you can navigate to what URL links you wish to open, in the terminal simply write "python script1.py phrase". 
An example of this would be "python script1.py school" and it would open the URL links that are connected to the phrase school.
Additionally, you can use Hotkeys to make it even more easier to use. 

Edit: I used a .bat file and put my path to shorten the command.
